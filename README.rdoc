= About

I love using custom fields for themes/plugins, but parsing them is sometimes a bitch. This is a very simple wrapper for some
wordpress functions that will return a nice formatted array for use with themes or other plugins.

If you are big into custom fields and playing around with them, check this plugin out, it should make life a bit easier.

= Examples

You have a post which has a bunch of images, but those images need titles, you can structure that in the post with custom fields like:
  
* +name+ : value
* +images+ : src=image01.jpg&title=my house&description=this is my house
* +images+ : src=image02.jpg&title=mountain&description=some awesome mountains
* +images+ : src=image03.jpg&title=beach&description=a sandy beach
* +images+ : sort=title&&lightbox=1&delay=0.5
  
You would get this array back:

  Array
  (
      [images] => Array
          (
              [0] => Array
                  (
                      [src] => image01.jpg
                      [title] => my house
                      [description] => this is my house
                  )

              [1] => Array
                  (
                      [src] => image03.jpg
                      [title] => beach
                      [description] => a sandy beach
                  )

              [2] => Array
                  (
                      [src] => image02.jpg
                      [title] => mountain
                      [description] => some awesome mountains
                  )

          )

      [gallery_options] => Array
          (
              [sort] => title
              [lightbox] => 1
              [delay] => 0.5
          )

  )
  
Pretty convenient, no? To get a single custom field use +meta(_key_)+:

  meta('gallery_options') => array('sort' => 'title', 'lightbox' => 1, 'delay' => 0.5)
  
Now you can use this within other plugins, or themes, or wherever.
